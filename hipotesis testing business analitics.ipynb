    "### Introduction\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a cornerstone of statistical analysis, enabling researchers, analysts, and decision-makers to draw meaningful conclusions from sample data. This powerful technique is widely used across diverse fields, from medicine and psychology to business and public policy. However, the technical jargon and mathematical complexity often make hypothesis testing seem daunting, especially for those without a strong statistical background.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article aims to demystify the concept of hypothesis testing, breaking down the key principles and steps in a clear and accessible manner. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of how hypothesis testing works, its practical applications, and the steps involved in conducting a hypothesis test. Whether you're a student, a professional, or simply someone with a curious mind, this guide will equip you with the knowledge and confidence to navigate the world of data-driven insights and make more informed decisions based on rigorous statistical analysis.\n"

    "### What is a Hypothesis?\n",
    "A hypothesis is a statement that can be tested. It’s an assumption or claim about a population parameter (like a mean or proportion). \n",

    "### Business Analytics Example\n",
    "In business analytics, hypothesis testing can help answer questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Marketing Campaigns**: Companies can use hypothesis testing to determine if a new marketing campaign had a significant effect on sales. The null hypothesis would be that the campaign had no impact, while the alternative is that it increased sales. By collecting sales data before and after the campaign and performing a statistical test like a t-test, the company can assess whether the difference in mean sales is statistically significant, allowing them to conclude if the campaign had a meaningful positive impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customer Satisfaction**: When launching a new product, businesses can use hypothesis testing to understand if the average customer satisfaction rating is different from their previous offerings. The null hypothesis would be that the mean satisfaction is the same as past products, while the alternative is that it is higher or lower. The company can survey customers, calculate the mean satisfaction score, and then use a one-sample t-test to compare this to the historical average, enabling them to determine if the new product has a significantly different customer satisfaction rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operational Efficiency**: Hypothesis testing can also help companies evaluate the impact of process improvements on operational efficiency. If a manufacturing company implements a new production process aimed at increasing efficiency, they can test the null hypothesis that the mean production time per unit is unchanged against the alternative that the mean time has decreased. By collecting production time data before and after the change and performing a two-sample t-test, the company can assess whether the difference in mean times is statistically significant, allowing them to conclude if the new process improved operational efficiency.\n",

    "### Types of hypotheses \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of hypotheses in hypothesis testing:\n",
    "1. **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: This is the default assumption that there is no effect or no difference. It represents the status quo .\n",
    "2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha)**: This is what you want to prove. It suggests that there is an effect or a difference .\n"

   "source": [
    "### Example to Illustrate\n",
    "Imagine you run a coffee shop and claim that your average customer satisfaction rating is 4.5 out of 5. A competitor doubts this and wants to test your claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: The average customer satisfaction rating is 4.5.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The average customer satisfaction rating is not 4.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps in Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "1. **State the Hypotheses**: Clearly define your null and alternative hypotheses .\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collect Data**: Gather a sample of data relevant to your hypothesis. For our example, you could collect satisfaction ratings from a sample of customers .\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Choose a Significance Level (α)**: This is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Common values are 0.05 (5%) or 0.01 (1%).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate a Test Statistic**: This is a standardized value derived from your sample data, which is used to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis. Examples include the t-statistic, z-statistic, or chi-square statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Determine the P-Value**: The p-value indicates the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct .\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Make a Decision**:\n",
    "   - If the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level (α), reject the null hypothesis (Rumsey, 2003).\n",
    "   - If the p-value is greater than α, do not reject the null hypothesis .\n",

    "### Example: Customer Satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you own a coffee shop and you believe your average customer satisfaction rating is 4.5 out of 5. You decide to test this hypothesis by surveying 30 customers and collecting their satisfaction ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State the Hypotheses**:\n",
    "   - Null Hypothesis (H0): The average customer satisfaction rating is 4.5.\n",
    "   - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The average customer satisfaction rating is not 4.5.   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collect Data**: After surveying 30 customers, you obtain the following ratings (out of 5): 4.6, 4.7, 4.5, 4.8, 4.2, 4.5, 4.7, 4.9, 4.3, 4.4, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 4.2, 4.5, 4.3, 4.1, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.3, 4.2, 4.5.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Choose a Significance Level (α)**: You choose a significance level of 0.05 (5%).   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate a Test Statistic**: Using statistical software or formulas, you calculate the test statistic. In this case, let's use a one-sample t-test to determine if the mean rating is different from 4.5.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the T-Statistic\n",
    "The t-statistic is a ratio that compares the difference between the sample mean and the hypothesized population mean relative to the variability of the sample data. It helps determine how far your sample mean is from the hypothesized mean, in units of standard error. A larger absolute value of the t-statistic indicates a larger difference between the sample mean and the hypothesized mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the t-statistic in a one-sample t-test is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{s / \\sqrt{n}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean.\n",
    "- $\\mu$ is the hypothesized population mean (4.5 in this example).\n",
    "- $s$ is the sample standard deviation.\n",
    "- $n$ is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Calculation\n",
    "1. **Calculate the sample mean $\\bar{x}$**:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum{x_i}}{n}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   For the given ratings: \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\bar{x} = \\frac{4.6 + 4.7 + 4.5 + \\cdots + 4.5}{30} = 4.53\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate the sample standard deviation $s$**:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}}{n-1}}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   For the given ratings, let's assume:\n",
    "   $$ \n",
    "   s \\approx 0.25\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate the t-statistic**:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   t = \\frac{4.53 - 4.5}{0.25 / \\sqrt{30}} = 0.66\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interpretation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-statistic value indicates how far the sample mean is from the hypothesized population mean in units of the standard error. In this example, a t-statistic of 0.66 means that the sample mean is 0.66 standard errors above the hypothesized mean of 4.5. \n",
    "\n",
    "A t-statistic closer to 0 suggests that the sample mean is close to the hypothesized mean, while a larger absolute value indicates a greater difference. Whether this difference is statistically significant depends on the corresponding p-value.\n"

To test this, you randomly select 10 students and find their average score to be 78 with a standard deviation of 4.
